# React Application Context

This is a React-based web application using Next.js framework. The application is structured with a frontend and backend separation.

## Frontend

- Built with Next.js
- Uses TypeScript
- Located in the `frontend` directory

Key files:

- `frontend/app/page.tsx`: Main page component
- `frontend/next.config.mjs`: Next.js configuration
- `frontend/next-env.d.ts`: TypeScript definitions for Next.js

## Backend

- Node.js based backend
- Located in the `backend` directory

Key files:

- `backend/index.js`: Main entry point for the backend
- `backend/.env`: Environment variables (not tracked in git)

## Version Control

- The project uses Git for version control
- `.gitignore` is set up to exclude certain files/directories from version control

This React application is designed with a clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend, following modern web development practices and utilizing Next.js for improved performance and developer experience.
